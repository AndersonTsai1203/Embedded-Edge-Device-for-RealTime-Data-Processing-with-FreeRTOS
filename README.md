# Embedded Edge Device for Real-Time Data Processing with FreeRTOS

Create an embedded IoT device running FreeRTOS that processes real-time sensor data and sends it to AWS IoT Core.

## Components

1. STM32 (e.g., STM32F4 Discovery)
2. FreeRTOS
3. Sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity)
4. AWS IoT Core
5. STM32CubeIDE

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up FreeRTOS on STM32

Open STM32CubeMX and create a new project for your STM32 board.
Enable FreeRTOS in the middleware section.
Configure tasks, timers, and interrupts as needed for real-time data processing.

### 2. Configure Sensors

Add sensor libraries or write custom drivers for I2C/SPI sensors.
Set up tasks to periodically read sensor data and process it.

### 3. Set Up AWS IoT Core Connection

Use an ESP8266 module (connected via UART) or an ESP32 to establish an MQTT connection with AWS IoT Core.
Implement an interface to transmit processed data to the Wi-Fi module.

### 4. Integrate MQTT Communication

In your FreeRTOS task, publish the processed data to AWS IoT Core.

### 5. Test and Deploy

Flash the firmware to your STM32 board and test it by monitoring the sensor data on AWS IoT Core.
Optimize FreeRTOS task priority and timing based on your real-time requirements.
